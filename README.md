# Star-Wars-Database-Project

Class: CSCI 3432 Database Systems

The target audience for this project are science fiction fans and gamers. We intend to make it easier for this audience to interact with a database that has information about the star wars universe so that they can not only find information that they need but also make changes to the database and see them. The user interacting with the database will be able to add, modify, and delete values.

We intend to use Java to develop the GUI application that will interact with the database. The interface will be composed of all the tables and when the user clicks on a particular table, they will be able to see the information in that table and also interact with that table using add, modify, and delete buttons. The user will be able to see the updated information in the interface itself once they make those changes.
